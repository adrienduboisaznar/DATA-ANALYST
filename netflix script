We only need to select the following variables :  type  and date_added */

/* Question 2 : -Is there seasonality in the dates when titles are added on the platform? 
On SQL : We only need to select the following variables : title and date_added */

/*Question 3 : -What are the top 5 movie directors that have the longest total movie duration available on Netflix ? */

/* On excel : type --> filter -> does not content « season » and « seasons » (copypast in an another sheet) ; 
in the new sheet I had to fix the duration variable that was a string variable. --> I generate a new variable =
durationinminutes=left(duration;3) in order to delete "min"
and I selected durationinminutes to convert it as a integer variable data->convert data > next ->advanced
-> decimal separator as "." and not as ","(default) -> now my variable is a string.
And to finish it : I fix the problem of names of "director" creating a new variable director= Trim(director)
-> end up with the eventual spaces and I create a new variable director to end up with the uppercase =lower()
I do  just in case that there is the same director but with a different character size
Now I finished cleaning my data  */
